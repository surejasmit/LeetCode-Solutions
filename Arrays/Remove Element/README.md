# Remove Element

📌 Problem Statement
Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in-place.
The relative order of the remaining elements may change.

You must return the number of elements k that are not equal to val.
The first k elements of nums should contain the valid values, and the remaining
elements can be ignored.



## Installation

Install my-project with npm

```bash
Input:  nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2
Updated nums = [2,2,_,_]
```

```bash
Input:  nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5
Updated nums = [0,1,3,0,4,_,_,_]
```

🧠 Key Observations
- The array must be modified in-place
- No extra array should be created
- Order of remaining elements is not important
- Only the first k elements matter
- This problem tests in-place array manipulation
